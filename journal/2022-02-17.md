## Web cache

#server-side-cache usually needs an extral tool like **#Redis**ï¼Œbut it gives you way more control of your cache.

#http-cache has two ways to work, **private** or **public**.

* The public cache is a #CDN, or another thing between server and user like a proxy. Set as **http header** like `"Cache-Control": "public, s-maxage=60"`
* The private cache is user's browser's own cahce.
